# Principle Neural Networks Engineering Course
The course of the Neural Networks is going to study from the principles to advanced level. There are also
implementations from scratch in `Python` as well as the coding by utilizing the libraries. The aim is to learn how to
model networks mathematically.


# Sessions
- Introduction to Neural Networks - Models of a Neuron
  
  - [Slides](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AshLtNFNHRW_iQb18HJ2Nz-BrPSM) are describing the neuron modeling.

- Introduction to Neural Networks - MLP
    - [Slides](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AshLtNFNHRW_iQX18HJ2Nz-BrPSM) are covering the theoretical and coding related to a `Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network`.
    - The related implementation from scratch is [ex0_mlp](examples/ex0_mlp.py).
