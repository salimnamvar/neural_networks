# Principle Neural Networks Engineering Course
The course of the Neural Networks is going to study from the principles to advanced level. There are also
implementations from scratch in `Python` as well as the coding by utilizing the libraries. The aim is to learn how to
model networks mathematically.


# Sessions
- Introduction to Neural Networks - Models of a Neuron

- Introduction to Neural Networks - MLP
    - The session is going to cover the theoretical and coding related to a `Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network`.
    - The related implementation from scratch is [ex0_mlp](examples/ex0_mlp.py).
